## Overview
**rDummyReaction-Jabara** is an R-based simulation tool that generates synthetic data representing catalytic reaction experiments. It creates a dataset by sampling various factors such as catalyst type, catalyst molarity, solvent type, temperature, and reaction time, and then computes the reaction yield along with associated attributes like crystal type and industry designation. This project is ideal for users who need dummy data for testing or demonstration purposes in the field of chemical reaction engineering.

## Key Features
- **Comprehensive Simulation**: Generates data by incorporating multiple reaction parameters including catalyst type, molarity, solvent, temperature, and time.
- **Dynamic Yield Calculation**: Implements a step-by-step process to calculate reaction yield based on optimal reaction times, noise factors, and process adjustments.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Easily modify simulation settings (e.g., number of samples, temperature levels, etc.) to fit different experimental scenarios.
- **CSV Output**: Exports the generated dataset to a CSV file for further analysis or integration with other applications.

---

## Dependencies
- **Programming Language/Framework**: R
- **Libraries/Packages**:  
  Base R (uses functions like `sample()`, `rnorm()`, etc.)
- **System Tools**:  
  - [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
  - [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) (optional, for development)

## Installation and Setup

### Required Tools
**Clone or Download the Repository**  
   Clone this repository or download the source files.

---

## Usage

### Running the Application
To run the simulation, simply execute the R script in your preferred R environment. For example, from the R console:
```r
source("path_to_your_script/catalyst_simulator.R")
```
This will generate a CSV file (`dummy_.csv`) containing the simulated data.

### Feature Management
- **Simulation Parameters**: Edit the sampling parameters (e.g., number of samples, temperature values) in the script to tailor the simulation.
- **Yield Calculation**: Modify the reaction yield calculation section if you need to adjust the simulation logic.
- **Output Customization**: Change the CSV output filename or data formatting as needed.

---

## Configuration
Customize various settings directly within the R script to tailor the simulation:
- **Sampling Settings**: Adjust the sample size (`n`) and parameter ranges.
- **Reaction Parameters**: Modify the constants and adjustments for optimal reaction time (`t_opt`) and yield calculation.
- **Noise Level**: Change the standard deviation in `rnorm()` to simulate different levels of experimental noise.
